  <p class="intro work__description">Building a design system for the NHS.</p>

  <img class="work__img" src="/images/work/nhs-service-manual.png" alt="">

  <p>I had the pleasure of working on the NHS design system and <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/">NHS digital sevice manual</a>, where I collaborated with an amazing team to create a design system that was accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly.</p>

  <!--<p>As part of my role, I helped to develop guidelines and standards that ensured consistency and quality across all NHS digital services. I also made sure that the design system and service manual were always up-to-date and accurate, meeting the needs of users.</p>

  <p>In addition to my design work, I had the opportunity to mentor mid-level and graduate designers, providing guidance and support to help them grow professionally.</p>-->

  <img class="work__img--border" src="/images/work/nhs/audit.jpg" alt="">

  <p>I facilitated team workshops to help identify all the components used across the NHS website and NHS services. This involved working with the team to map out the different elements and ensure that everyone had a clear understanding of the design and functionality of each component.</p>
  
  <img class="work__img--border" src="/images/work/nhs/component-audit.jpg" alt="">

  <p>I took responsibility for documenting the design components and collaborated closely with the design community to uncover past user research and design rationale.</p> 
  <p>This involved conducting extensive research, documenting design decisions and their reasoning, and sharing this information with the team. By doing so, I ensured that everyone had a clear understanding of the design choices and could make informed decisions about future design iterations.</p>

  <p>To develop design concepts and visual representations, I used Sketch and Figma. These tools allowed me to explore various design languages and create visual representations that effectively conveyed the concepts.</p>

  <p>To enhance the design and usability of the product, I created prototypes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which were tested with users to obtain feedback. Working in a multi-disciplinary team with user researchers, we conducted iterative testing with a varied group of users. This involved collaborating to design test scenarios, recruit participants, and evaluate user feedback to enhance the product's user experience. Through this collaborative approach, we refined the design to satisfy the needs of our users.</p>

  <img class="work__img--border" src="/images/work/nhs/frontend-code.png" alt="">

  <p>I contributed code to the <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/graphs/contributors">NHS.UK Frontend</a>, while adhering to the coding standards.</p>

  <img class="work__img--border" src="/images/work/nhs/guidance.png" alt="">

  <p>I collaborated closely with a content designer and the design community to develop guidance for the design system. This involved working together to ensure that the guidance accurately reflected the design principles and was communicated effectively to the intended audience.</p>

  <img class="work__img--border" src="/images/work/nhs/community-backlog.png" alt="">

  <p>I helped create the <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog">NHS community backlog</a>, a place for teams building NHS or other health and care services to work together.</p>

  <p>Throughout my time at NHS, I advocated for working in the open, promoting accessibility and inclusion, and collaborated with the design community to further these initiatives. I'm proud to have been part of such an impactful project and excited about its future potential, as highlighted in a <a href="https://deanvipond.medium.com/a-short-ish-history-of-the-nhs-design-system-part-6-2022-where-next-d3cfc303c2a3">blog post by my former colleague, Dean Vipond, on Medium</a>.</p>
