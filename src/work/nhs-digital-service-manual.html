  <p>I had the pleasure of working on the NHS design system and <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/">NHS digital sevice manual</a>, where I collaborated with an amazing team to create a design system that was accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly.</p>

  <p>As part of my role, I helped to develop guidelines and standards that ensured consistency and quality across all NHS digital services. I also made sure that the design system and service manual were always up-to-date and accurate, meeting the needs of users.</p>

  <p>In addition to my design work, I had the opportunity to mentor mid-level and graduate designers, providing guidance and support to help them grow professionally.</p>

  <p>Throughout my time at NHS, I advocated for working in the open, promoting accessibility and inclusion, and collaborated with the design community to further these initiatives. It was an incredible experience, and I'm proud to have been a part of such an impactful project.</p>
