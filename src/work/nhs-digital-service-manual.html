  <p>I collaborated with an amazing team to create an accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly design system for the NHS.</p>

  <p>I facilitated workshops to identify design components and documented past user research and design rationale.</p>

  <p>Using Sketch and Figma, I created visual representations and built HTML prototypes for iterative user testing.</p>

  <p>I contributed code to the NHS.UK Frontend and collaborated with a content designer and the design community to develop guidance for the design system.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I helped create the NHS community backlog, a place for teams building NHS or other health and care services to work together.</p>

  <p>During my time at NHS, I promoted open collaboration, accessibility, and inclusion in design. I worked closely with the design community to advance these initiatives, and I'm proud of the significant impact we achieved. I'm excited about the future potential of the NHS digital service manual, as highlighted in <a href="https://deanvipond.medium.com/a-short-ish-history-of-the-nhs-design-system-part-6-2022-where-next-d3cfc303c2a3">a Medium blog post by my former colleague, Dean Vipond</a>.</p>
