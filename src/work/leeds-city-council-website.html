  <img class="work__img" src="/images/work/lcc.png" alt="">

  <p>I had the incredible opportunity to lead the redesign of Leeds.gov.uk, working closely with a multi-disciplinary team to meet the needs of both users and the business.</p>

  <p>Throughout the project, I conducted extensive user research and analysed data to develop solutions that would work best for everyone. I created sketches, wireframes, hi-fidelity mock-ups, and HTML prototypes to help the team visualise and communicate the design solutions.</p>
    
  <p>As accessibility lead for the digital team, I made sure that accessibility and inclusion were at the forefront of our work. I worked tirelessly to ensure that all digital services were accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.</p>
