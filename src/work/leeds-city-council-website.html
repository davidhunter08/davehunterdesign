  <p>I led the redesign of Leeds.gov.uk, collaborating with a multi-disciplinary team to meet user and business goals. My work involved extensive user research and data analysis to develop effective solutions. I created sketches, wireframes, hi-fidelity mock-ups, and HTML prototypes to communicate design solutions to the team. Additionally, I prioritised accessibility and inclusion as the accessibility lead for the digital team, ensuring all digital services were accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.</p>
